                <main>

                     <p>I am sitting on a mountain path. It is quite like Japan, a pine forest sloping off steeply to the left of the path and the flat ridge of the mountain just a little bit further up on the right.
                </p>


                <p>
                    There are two concrete pillars on either end of the step, and we both have our backs against a pillar, about two metres apart. We both have kind of cup in front of us, like an origami paper cup made from beautiful printed paper. I think of all the little handmade things I used to make. But then I see there is some kind of logo on the cups, they are some kind of gimmick like out of a McHappy meal. I think I have decided to kill the priest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know why, it is a decision I feel a bit uneasy with but I have to carry through now. I get up, maybe in indecision, and walk back down the path a bit. There is a deer standing quite still up the hill on my left. I get out my gun and shoot it. I get the sense now it is a forest reserve in America. Instead of taking the deer's horns, you are meant to leave the de-horning to a ranger and go and pick up a substitute set of horns from a selection stuck to a wooden board on the mountain ridge.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I do this, but when I get back I discover that the substitute horns are just branches, and am a bit angry. I go back and sit with the priest. He starts telling me how when he started his job, his aim was to kill half of his parish in a kind of rampage. But he was gradually won over by everyone and now goes about his job like a normal priest. I think I am influenced by this story and end up not killing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later I am in a coffee shop, run by some kind of charity. A Japanese regular walks in, and sees that there are no seats free. He is an angry kind of man, and starts to walk off in a huff. "Iku tokoro deshita" I call out to him, "I was just leaving" (in possibly dodgy grammar). This is met by an approving look from the person behind the counter. I think I must have been staying in accommodation run by the charity, because the next morning I am still there. There is some kind of seminar or talk on, it has the feeling of a kind of Rotary/Lions Club event, though I've never been to one. I am packing up my rucksack as people arrange chairs around me. I think I am going to be embroiled in this talk and have to stay, even though I had intended to move on. But something tells me no - quickly, get a move on before the talk starts, don't waste the day.
                </p>
